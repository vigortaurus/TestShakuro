Goal of this test:
	To see your ability to analyse code and familiarity with basic algorithms

	This project is a simple console application containing one class (Program) with two static methods (Foo and Bar), which do something. For both methods you need to:
		1) Find out what this method does.
		2) Describe the advantages/disadvantages of such implementation as a comment in code.
		3) Implement better approach (if you see it).
